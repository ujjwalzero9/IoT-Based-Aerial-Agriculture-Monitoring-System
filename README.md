## Technical Components

### 1. Difference between Raspberry Pi and Raspberry Pi Pico

- **Raspberry Pi**:
  - A single-board computer suitable for various applications.
  
- **Raspberry Pi Pico**:
  - A microcontroller board designed for embedded projects.

### 2. Video Streaming Resolution on Raspberry Pi

- The resolution depends on the model:
  - Raspberry Pi 4 supports 4K resolution.

### 3. Installing OS on Raspberry Pi

- Steps:
  1. Download the OS image.
  2. Write the image to a microSD card using tools like Etcher or `dd`.

### 4. GPIO Pins on Raspberry Pi

- Varies by model:
  - Raspberry Pi 4 has 40 GPIO pins.

### 5. I2C on Raspberry Pi

- Typically includes one or more channels:
  - Accessible through GPIO2 (SDA) and GPIO3 (SCL).

### 6. SPI on Raspberry Pi

- Typically includes two channels:
  - Accessible through GPIO10 (MOSI), GPIO9 (MISO), GPIO11 (SCLK), and GPIO8 (CE0).

### 7. UART on Raspberry Pi

- Typically includes one or more channels:
  - Accessible through GPIO14 (TXD) and GPIO15 (RXD).

### 8. Headless Installation of OS on Raspberry Pi

- Set up without a monitor, keyboard, or mouse:
  1. Enable SSH by placing an empty file named `ssh` in the boot partition.
  2. Configure remotely via SSH or pre-configured files on the microSD card.

## Additional Information

### Conversion Metrics

#### 1. Metric to Inches

- Length:
  - Inches = Centimeters * 0.3937
  
- Area:
  - Square Inches = Square Centimeters * 0.155

#### 2. Celsius to Fahrenheit Conversion

- Celsius to Fahrenheit:
  - \( F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32 \)
  
- Fahrenheit to Celsius:
  - \( C = \frac{5}{9}(F - 32) \)

### Working with Raspberry Pi Without External Monitor, Mouse, and Keyboard

1. **Enable SSH**:
   - Place an empty file named `ssh` in the boot partition.
   
2. **Connect Using SSH**:
   - Use the command `ssh pi@<IP_address>` and enter the password when prompted.

### SSH and Connecting to Raspberry Pi

- **SSH**:
  - Secure remote access protocol.
  
- **Connection**:
  - Connect to Raspberry Pi using `ssh pi@<IP_address>`. Enter the password when prompted.
